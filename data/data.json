It came out in the same year that Queen Elizabeth II celebrated 25 years on the throne. The song shocked many people because it criticized the monarchy and was even banned by the BBC. The cover showed a picture of the Queen with her eyes and mouth covered by bold words.

The cover showed a picture of the Queen with her eyes and mouth covered by bold words. At the same time, punk fashion was growing, and designer Vivienne Westwood helped make this new style visible through clothes and images. Because the song was so different from traditional music, it became very popular with young people who felt angry or misunderstood. Punk music was loud, fast, and simple, and it talked about real problems instead of polite stories. The image on the cover became just as famous as the song. It looked rough and unfinished, breaking the rules of how records usually looked. Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren sold T-shirts in their London shop using the same image as the record cover. Wearing these shirts allowed young people to show that they did not agree with old rules and traditions. Through music and fashion together, “God Save the Queen” helped punk become a powerful way to express freedom, rebellion, and identity.",
        "kid-expert-short": "Released in May 1977, “God Save the Queen” was the Sex Pistols’ second single and one of the most controversial songs in British history. Its lyrics criticized the monarchy during the Queen’s Silver Jubilee, leading to censorship and strong reactions from the media. The single’s artwork, created by Jamie Reid, altered a royal portrait using cut-out lettering, turning a symbol of authority into a sign of rebellion.",

The single’s artwork, created by Jamie Reid, altered a royal portrait using cut-out lettering, turning a symbol of authority into a sign of rebellion. This visual style was inspired by collage and protest art and was meant to look aggressive and unfinished. By changing the Queen’s image, the artwork questioned power and respect in a direct and shocking way. Vivienne Westwood used this same image on clothing sold in her shop, helping to bring punk ideas into everyday life. The clothes were not meant to be beautiful in a traditional sense but to make people think and react. Through this connection between music, art, and fashion, punk became more than a sound. It became a movement that allowed young people to challenge society and express their feelings openly.",

Vivienne Westwood’s adoption of this imagery in fashion linked the single to the visual identity of punk culture. This connection between music and imagery helped the single reach far beyond record stores. Despite censorship, the song became extremely popular and is often remembered as the sound of a generation rejecting established authority. Reid’s graphic design broke with traditional record sleeves by using ransom-note typography and visual disruption, reinforcing the song’s confrontational message. Westwood, working closely with Malcolm McLaren, brought this same aesthetic into clothing through T-shirts sold in their boutique. These garments turned punk graphics into everyday statements, allowing wearers to publicly align themselves with anti-establishment values. Together, the song and its imagery show how punk used multiple creative fields to communicate a shared cultural message.",
        "adult-expert-short": "“God Save the Queen” represents a crucial convergence of sound, graphic design, and fashion within punk culture. The single deploys visual and lyrical provocation to undermine institutional authority, particularly through the deliberate defacement of royal imagery. Vivienne Westwood’s engagement with this aesthetic demonstrates how punk’s visual language extended beyond music into design practice.",

The single deploys visual and lyrical provocation to undermine institutional authority, particularly through the deliberate defacement of royal imagery. Vivienne Westwood’s engagement with this aesthetic demonstrates how punk’s visual language extended beyond music into design practice. Westwood’s translation of the single’s graphic language into fashion materialized most clearly in the “God Save the Queen” T-shirt, produced and sold in her boutique with Malcolm McLaren in 1977. The garment adopted Jamie Reid’s defaced royal portrait through screen-printing techniques that emphasized flatness, visual aggression, and immediacy rather than refinement. The T-shirt itself, a traditionally utilitarian and mass-produced item, was deliberately recontextualized as a political surface. Westwood exploited its associations with youth culture and everyday wear, using it as a canvas for dissent. Distressed finishes, provocative slogans, and confrontational iconography rejected conventional notions of taste, craftsmanship, and luxury that dominated British fashion at the time. This approach aligned with Westwood’s broader punk methodology, which privileged anti-construction, symbolic abrasion, and the exposure of process over tailored perfection. Garments were not designed to flatter the body or conform to established silhouettes but to communicate attitude, ideology, and resistance. By integrating Reid’s graphic détournement into wearable form, Westwood collapsed the boundaries between record sleeve, protest poster, and fashion object. The “God Save the Queen” T-shirt thus became a foundational example of fashion as visual rhetoric, positioning clothing as an active participant in punk’s challenge to cultural authority and redefining design practice as an explicitly political act.

From the raw energy of punk rebellion to refined tailoring and historical reinterpretation, each item embodies her revolutionary approach to fashion, transforming traditional forms such as the corset and Scottish tartan into symbols of power and innovation. Beyond their aesthetic impact, these works also carry her enduring commitment to activism, integrating social and environmental protest into the very fabric of design. Together, they reveal a vision defined not just by garments, but by the principles and audacity that make every object unmistakably Made by Vivienne.",

      "description": "Past and Future traces the interplay of references that shaped Vivienne Westwood’s distinctive vision, bringing together the works that informed her creativity, the designs that emerged from those influences, and the cultural echoes her style continues to generate. Starting with the historical and artistic references that nourished her imagination, the collection moves into the garments and accessories that exemplify her transformative approach to tradition, before closing with the many afterlives of her designs in contemporary media and popular culture, from the iconic wedding gown worn by Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City to the striking appearances of Westwood’s creations in Nana, alongside records that witness her public activism and irreverence. Overall, the collection aims at revealing the continuous exchange between past reference and future expression within Westwood’s creative universe.",
