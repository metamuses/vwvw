It came out in the same year that Queen Elizabeth II celebrated 25 years on the throne. The song shocked many people because it criticized the monarchy and was even banned by the BBC. The cover showed a picture of the Queen with her eyes and mouth covered by bold words.

The cover showed a picture of the Queen with her eyes and mouth covered by bold words. At the same time, punk fashion was growing, and designer Vivienne Westwood helped make this new style visible through clothes and images. Because the song was so different from traditional music, it became very popular with young people who felt angry or misunderstood. Punk music was loud, fast, and simple, and it talked about real problems instead of polite stories. The image on the cover became just as famous as the song. It looked rough and unfinished, breaking the rules of how records usually looked. Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren sold T-shirts in their London shop using the same image as the record cover. Wearing these shirts allowed young people to show that they did not agree with old rules and traditions. Through music and fashion together, “God Save the Queen” helped punk become a powerful way to express freedom, rebellion, and identity.",

The single’s artwork, created by Jamie Reid, altered a royal portrait using cut-out lettering, turning a symbol of authority into a sign of rebellion. This visual style was inspired by collage and protest art and was meant to look aggressive and unfinished. By changing the Queen’s image, the artwork questioned power and respect in a direct and shocking way. Vivienne Westwood used this same image on clothing sold in her shop, helping to bring punk ideas into everyday life. The clothes were not meant to be beautiful in a traditional sense but to make people think and react. Through this connection between music, art, and fashion, punk became more than a sound. It became a movement that allowed young people to challenge society and express their feelings openly.",

The cover artwork, designed by Jamie Reid, transformed an official royal portrait into a provocative punk image. Vivienne Westwood’s adoption of this imagery in fashion linked the single to the visual identity of punk culture. This connection between music and imagery helped the single reach far beyond record stores. Despite censorship, the song became extremely popular and is often remembered as the sound of a generation rejecting established authority. Reid’s graphic design broke with traditional record sleeves by using ransom-note typography and visual disruption, reinforcing the song’s confrontational message. Westwood, working closely with Malcolm McLaren, brought this same aesthetic into clothing through T-shirts sold in their boutique. These garments turned punk graphics into everyday statements, allowing wearers to publicly align themselves with anti-establishment values. Together, the song and its imagery show how punk used multiple creative fields to communicate a shared cultural message.",
        "adult-expert-short": "“God Save the Queen” represents a crucial convergence of sound, graphic design, and fashion within punk culture. The single deploys visual and lyrical provocation to undermine institutional authority, particularly through the deliberate defacement of royal imagery. Vivienne Westwood’s engagement with this aesthetic demonstrates how punk’s visual language extended beyond music into design practice.",
        "adult-expert-long": "“God Save the Queen” represents a crucial convergence of sound, graphic design, and fashion within punk culture. The single deploys visual and lyrical provocation to undermine institutional authority, particularly through the deliberate defacement of royal imagery. Vivienne Westwood’s engagement with this aesthetic demonstrates how punk’s visual language extended beyond music into design practice. Westwood’s translation of the single’s graphic language into fashion materialized most clearly in the “God Save the Queen” T-shirt, produced and sold in her boutique with Malcolm McLaren in 1977. The garment adopted Jamie Reid’s defaced royal portrait through screen-printing techniques that emphasized flatness, visual aggression, and immediacy rather than refinement. The T-shirt itself, a traditionally utilitarian and mass-produced item, was deliberately recontextualized as a political surface. Westwood exploited its associations with youth culture and everyday wear, using it as a canvas for dissent. Distressed finishes, provocative slogans, and confrontational iconography rejected conventional notions of taste, craftsmanship, and luxury that dominated British fashion at the time. This approach aligned with Westwood’s broader punk methodology, which privileged anti-construction, symbolic abrasion, and the exposure of process over tailored perfection. Garments were not designed to flatter the body or conform to established silhouettes but to communicate attitude, ideology, and resistance. By integrating Reid’s graphic détournement into wearable form, Westwood collapsed the boundaries between record sleeve, protest poster, and fashion object. The “God Save the Queen” T-shirt thus became a foundational example of fashion as visual rhetoric, positioning clothing as an active participant in punk’s challenge to cultural authority and redefining design practice as an explicitly political act.

She worked with expert Scottish weavers to create her very own tartan. In her fashion shows, she used the MacAndreas tartan on mini skirts, jackets, dresses, and scarves, sometimes mixing it with other patterns or materials. The clothes looked playful and surprising. Some had funny shapes, some were layered, and some had bright colors that really stood out. By wearing these clothes, people could show they were brave, creative, and liked to be different.

The tartan exemplifies Westwood’s approach of combining heritage textile patterns with contemporary punk-inspired design. Vivienne Westwood’s MacAndreas tartan illustrates her signature strategy of transforming traditional fabrics into avant-garde fashion statements. In her Anglomania AW 1993/94 collection, she applied the tartan to tailored jackets, asymmetric skirts, and layered ensembles, often contrasting it with unexpected fabrics or cuts. Its repeated presence in subsequent collections reinforced its status as a signature motif. By integrating a historical Scottish textile into garments that played with proportion, structure, and layering, Westwood showed how a designer could reinterpret heritage with a bold, contemporary eye. The tartan’s use in multiple runway collections made it both a visual anchor and a symbol of her punk-influenced design philosophy, blending tradition with rebellion.",

Its application on kilts, jackets, tailored skirts, and layered outfits illustrates her deliberate blending of historical reference with punk and avant-garde fashion language. The MacAndreas tartan occupies a central role in Westwood’s exploration of textile heritage within contemporary fashion. Initially featured in Anglomania AW 1993/94, it reappeared in subsequent collections, including AW 1994, Punkature, and later runway shows, often layered, pleated, or cut asymmetrically to interact with her signature silhouettes. Westwood utilized techniques such as pattern direction manipulation, asymmetric tailoring, layering, and distressed finishes to challenge the static associations of tartan with formal Scottish attire. Screen-printed and woven versions of the MacAndreas tartan adorned mini kilts, tailored jackets, corsetry, dresses, and layered ensembles, transforming it into a vehicle for visual and cultural subversion. By juxtaposing the tartan with contrasting fabrics and unconventional cuts, Westwood destabilized expectations of symmetry, polish, and historical fidelity, asserting designer authorship over both pattern and garment structure. Through its repeated presence on the runway, the MacAndreas tartan became a signature emblem of Westwood’s design philosophy, exemplifying how a heritage textile can be elevated to a political and stylistic statement within fashion, blending Scottish tradition, punk ethos, and couture-level construction."

People wore it to show they questioned old rules and liked bold, different styles. Vivienne and Malcolm made the T-shirt in London and sold it in their punk shop called Seditionaries. The shirt was meant for young people who loved punk music and the loud, fierce look that came with it. It was not plain like most T-shirts: the seams and edges were made to look rough on purpose, and the big picture on the front stood out strongly against the white cotton. The picture shows the Queen with a safety pin on her face and the words around her, just like in the punk song that shouted “God Save the Queen”. Wearing this shirt was a statement; it told everyone, “I want to do things my own way!”. It was exciting and shocking to many people at the time. This top became very famous because it mixed music, fashion, and rebellion all in one piece of clothing. It helped make punk style something that lots of people around the world remember even today.",

The shirt’s graphic image, featuring an altered portrait of Queen Elizabeth II with a safety pin, shocked the public and helped define the raw, rebellious look of early punk fashion. This top is not like a regular T-shirt; its design uses a strong picture that was made to represent how punk rock musicians and fans felt about society and rules in the 1970s. The image came from the iconic artwork of the Sex Pistols’ single God Save the Queen, which was meant to surprise and even upset people. On the shirt, the Queen’s face is changed by a safety pin, and words from the song are arranged around her, showing how punk artists mixed clothes and music to express their ideas. Vivienne and Malcolm sold this shirt at their Seditionaries shop on King’s Road, and people who wore it showed that they wanted to stand out and be different. The rough edges and bold design made it part of punk culture, a style that said “We do things in our own way”. Because of this, the top became one of the most famous pieces of punk fashion ever made.",

This top became an emblem of early British punk fashion, blending music, visual art, and clothing into a single provocative cultural artefact. The God Save the Queen top occupies a central place in the history of punk design as one of the earliest and most influential examples of fashion’s engagement with subculture and political critique. Created in the late 1970s by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, the shirt was sold at Seditionaries, their boutique on King’s Road, a crucible for punk aesthetics, cultural exchange, and anti-establishment design experimentation. The graphic derives directly from Jamie Reid’s lithographic treatment for the Sex Pistols’ God Save the Queen single, a defaced portrait of Queen Elizabeth II that became synonymous with punk’s challenge to national authority and popular imagery. By transposing this visual onto cotton knitwear, Westwood transformed political provocation into wearable iconography. The top’s intentional roughness, including raw seams, visible stitching, and distressed surfaces, aligned it with punk’s broader rejection of polished fashion norms and its embrace of anti-fashion gestures that foregrounded material disruption over conventional refinement. This design not only articulated punk’s visual language in garment form but also helped establish a template for how fashion could engage directly with music, youth identity, and visual culture, making the T-shirt itself a potent cultural artefact that echoed across subsequent decades of style and performance art.",
        "adult-expert-short": "The God Save the Queen top exemplifies cross-disciplinary design strategies at the intersection of fashion, graphic art, and subcultural expression. Its appropriation of Jamie Reid’s subversive lithography onto cotton knitwear illustrates Vivienne Westwood’s early exploration of design as visual critique, where surface and structure are deployed to challenge established cultural narratives.",

Its appropriation of Jamie Reid’s subversive lithography onto cotton knitwear illustrates Vivienne Westwood’s early exploration of design as visual critique, where surface and structure are deployed to challenge established cultural narratives. The God Save the Queen top is a defining artifact in the evolution of punk fashion as a disciplined design practice, in which clothing becomes an active medium of cultural critique rather than passive ornamentation. Emerging from the milieu of the Seditionaries boutique circa 1976–1977, it represents a deliberate appropriation of Jamie Reid’s graphic lexicon, a defaced royal portrait interwoven with provocative text, as a surface strategy applied to knitwear. This shirt’s design logic reflects Westwood’s early interrogation of fashion’s role in transmitting ideology: the deliberate visibility of seams and raw edges speaks to a constructional aesthetic that privileges disruption and anti-aesthetic rhetoric over the polished silhouettes typical of mainstream collections of the era. Such techniques prefigure later punk-influenced looks on runway and in couture, where the boundaries between garment and graphic artifact blur. Within the context of late 1970s London, God Save the Queen operated not merely as apparel but as a mobile graphic statement, worn by musicians, performers, and youth culture figures who foregrounded resistance through fashion. Its presence in key institutional collections today underscores its significance as an early exemplar of fashion’s capacity to engage with political and cultural narratives."

This earring shows how punk fashion was not afraid to be loud, cheeky, and different. Even something tiny, like an earring, could send a strong message. Vivienne believed that clothes and accessories could talk, just like music or art. That is why she chose a word that was usually considered rude or secret and turned it into something you could wear proudly. The SEX earring was worn by people who liked punk style and wanted to show they were brave and not afraid of rules. It was often paired with other bold clothes, like ripped shirts, safety pins, or colorful outfits. By making jewelry with strong words, Vivienne showed that fashion did not have to be quiet or polite. The SEX earring became a symbol of punk ideas: freedom, rebellion, and the courage to be yourself.",

Vivienne Westwood understood this very well and turned language into a design element. The SEX earring was not meant to shock just for fun; it was meant to question why certain words were forbidden or uncomfortable. By wearing it, people showed that they were not afraid of breaking social rules. This earring appeared together with other bold Westwood designs and became part of a punk look that mixed humor, rebellion, and confidence. It showed that fashion could be playful and serious at the same time, even when it was very small.",

The piece demonstrates how punk symbolism extended beyond garments into accessories, reinforcing fashion as a medium of cultural provocation. Westwood’s SEX earring reflects her long-standing engagement with provocative typography and confrontational messaging. Small in scale but high in impact, the earring distills punk ideology into a single word rendered as ornament. Rather than serving a purely decorative function, the piece operates as a statement object, aligning the wearer with anti-establishment values and freedom of expression. The earring was worn by figures connected to punk and alternative fashion scenes, including musicians, performers, and models associated with Westwood’s circle, reinforcing its role as a visible marker of subcultural identity. By elevating language to the status of jewelry, Westwood blurred the boundary between graphic design and personal adornment, demonstrating how even accessories could communicate ideology and attitude within punk fashion.",

Its blunt textual form challenges traditional hierarchies of refinement in jewelry, aligning accessories with punk’s broader rejection of polite aesthetics and passive consumption. Within Westwood’s runway collections of the early 1990s, accessories such as the SEX earring played a crucial role in completing the punk-inflected narrative of the look. Appearing alongside deconstructed tailoring, slogan-based garments, and historical references, the earring functioned as a concentrated symbol of confrontation. From a design perspective, the piece redefines jewelry as graphic punctuation rather than embellishment. Its typographic clarity mirrors Westwood’s continued interest in text-based fashion, seen across collections that merged political language, erotic provocation, and historical critique. On the runway, such accessories amplified the ideological content of the garments, ensuring that even minimal elements contributed to the overall message. The SEX earring, worn with tailored jackets, corsetry, or layered ensembles, reinforced the idea that punk operates through accumulative visual signals rather than isolated statements. As part of Westwood’s wider design system, the earring exemplifies how small-scale objects can carry disproportionate cultural weight, transforming jewelry into an active participant in fashion’s discourse on power, morality, and self-expression."

The hat is important because it shows her role as a designer, not just a character. By mixing royal clothes with her own fashion ideas, Vivienne shows that tradition can be changed and reimagined. The photograph helps us understand that fashion is not only about clothes, but also about ideas, imagination, and confidence.",
        "adult-amateur-short": "This 1988 photograph by Angus McBean portrays Vivienne Westwood dressed as the Queen of England while wearing a hat of her own design. The image captures Westwood’s irreverent relationship with British tradition, blending homage, irony, and self-authorship. It highlights her use of dress as a tool for cultural commentary.",

The image captures Westwood’s irreverent relationship with British tradition, blending homage, irony, and self-authorship. It highlights her use of dress as a tool for cultural commentary. Angus McBean’s portrait presents Vivienne Westwood in full royal costume, yet the image is far from straightforward imitation. By placing herself in the role of the monarch, Westwood stages a visual dialogue between authority and dissent. The inclusion of a hat designed by Westwood herself is central: it asserts her identity as a fashion designer intervening directly within the symbols of British power. This photograph reflects her ability to use clothing and accessories as conceptual devices, transforming fashion into a form of visual critique. The result is an image that is both celebratory and subversive, encapsulating Westwood’s complex relationship with heritage.",
        "adult-expert-short": "The photograph functions as a constructed fashion portrait, in which Westwood performs British identity through costume. By occupying the visual language of monarchy while inserting her own design, the hat, she asserts authorship over tradition, turning fashion into a critical medium.",
        "adult-expert-long": "The photograph functions as a constructed fashion portrait, in which Westwood performs British identity through costume. By occupying the visual language of monarchy while inserting her own design, the hat, she asserts authorship over tradition, turning fashion into a critical medium. Angus McBean’s 1988 portrait of Vivienne Westwood operates at the intersection of fashion, performance, and national symbolism. By dressing as the Queen of England, Westwood engages directly with the visual codes of British authority, yet the gesture is deliberately destabilized through exaggeration and self-awareness. Crucially, the hat she wears, designed by Westwood herself, functions as a sartorial signature. In fashion terms, the accessory disrupts the historical costume by inserting contemporary authorship into a traditionally codified ensemble. This act aligns with Westwood’s broader design practice, in which historical references are not reproduced faithfully but reworked through cut, proportion, and concept. The photograph mirrors her runway approach, where heritage garments are recontextualized to expose their ideological foundations. Rather than parody alone, the image articulates a complex stance: reverence for British tailoring and ceremony combined with a punk-informed impulse to question power. Through costume, styling, and accessory design, Westwood transforms portraiture into a fashion statement that collapses the boundaries between designer, subject, and symbol."

People who loved punk style wore them to show they didn’t want to follow old fashion rules. These shoes helped make punk fashion famous around the world. Vivienne Westwood created these shoes when she and Malcolm McLaren ran a shop in London that sold clothes for young people who wanted to be different. The shop was important in the beginning of punk culture, where music, art, and fashion all mixed together. Most shoes at the time were plain, but these had shiny metal studs attached to them, making them look loud and noticeable. Kids who liked punk music and bold clothes wore them with ripped pants, leather jackets, and colorful hair. By adding studs - something usually seen on belts or jackets - to shoes, Vivienne made footwear that felt rebellious and powerful. These studded shoes were part of the first wave of punk fashion, helping young people show that they wanted clothes that matched their energy and ideas.",

These shoes were part of the radical street style sold at Westwood and Malcolm McLaren’s London boutique during the rise of punk. In the context of early 1970s London, Vivienne Westwood’s studded shoes represent a design intervention that reframed simple footwear as cultural commentary. Emerging contemporaneously with the boutique later known as SEX, Westwood’s work during this period embraced materials and treatments that signaled defiance and non-conformity. By incorporating metal studs - elements historically linked to functional durability - into shoe design, she subverted conventional notions of refinement and wearability. Instead of smooth, polished surfaces typical of mainstream fashion, these shoes foregrounded raw materials and silhouette disruption. Sold alongside provocative garments in the boutique, they helped define a visual identity that rejected polite dress codes and embraced a vocabulary of punk visual aggression.",
        "adult-expert-short": "The studded shoes exemplify early material subversion and symbolic styling in Westwood’s work, where footwear adopts aggressive detailing as a mode of cultural expression.

Their construction, integrating metal studs onto soft shoe forms, challenges traditional hierarchies of dress and links accessory design to punk’s broader semiotic framework of resistance. The studded shoes occupy a formative position in Westwood’s design trajectory and in the material culture of early punk fashion. Produced in 1974, at a moment when Westwood’s boutique in London was transforming youth street style, these shoes exemplify how accessories became vehicles for ideological expression as much as functional objects. From a technical standpoint, the integration of metal studs onto traditional footwear represents a deliberate disruption of normative design: studs, historically associated with utilitarian or protective equipment, are recontextualized as decorative and confrontational. This choice destabilizes conventional expectations of shoe aesthetics and signals a break from refinement toward a vocabulary of visual defiance. Stylistically, the shoes were often paired with other emblematic elements of early punk ensembles, including bondage trousers, leather jackets, and slogan tees, establishing a cohesive subcultural look. In doing so, the shoes served not merely as accouterments but as semiotic anchors that reinforced the movement’s rejection of mainstream fashion norms. Their influence extends into later runway presentations and retrospective exhibitions that trace the lineage of Westwood’s work, showing how early punk ethos informed her subsequent exploration of historical references, silhouette manipulation, and cultural commentary in fashion design."

The design didn’t try to be calm or pretty; instead it showed big letters and bold images that made people stop and look. Punk fans loved it because it made them feel strong and different.

The piece was produced in cotton with extended silhouette features typical of the era’s DIY aesthetic. Emerging from Westwood and McLaren’s Seditionaries boutique, the Destroy T-shirt represents a key moment in the visual evolution of punk fashion. The graphic, anchored by the word “DESTROY” printed boldly across the front, was designed to provoke and disrupt. Punk was not only a musical movement but also a cultural rebellion that challenged mainstream values through music, attitude, and style. By placing confrontational language and imagery on cotton muslin, Westwood and McLaren transformed everyday clothing into a medium of critique. Sold alongside other radical designs in their London shop, the shirt became a marker of identity for punks who rejected polished fashion in favor of expressive, provocative garments. This T-shirt remains emblematic of how clothing can channel social sentiment and artistic defiance.",

Its placement within the early punk lexicon reflects a deliberate anti-fashion strategy, repurposing domestic materials and screen-print graphics to destabilize expectations of decorum and taste. The Destroy T-shirt occupies a pivotal role in the narrative of British punk fashion, where apparel transcends utility to function as cultural text. Produced in 1977 by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren during the peak of their Seditionaries influence, the shirt embodies a confluence of graphic subversion and sartorial rebellion. Visually, the shirt’s bold typographic intervention - the word “DESTROY” - is compounded by confrontational imagery, aligning with punk’s rejection of complacency and conventional aesthetics. It belongs to a family of screen-printed garments that circulated through Seditionaries, where extended silhouettes and raw finishes echoed the movement’s anti-establishment ethos. This approach treated clothing not as mere ornament but as communicative artifact, akin to protest graphics or zine culture. By deploying language and arresting imagery on cotton, Westwood and McLaren challenged the dominant paradigms of fashion production and consumption. In its historical context, this T-shirt resonates with other punk signifiers, such as torn denim, safety pins, and DIY customization, advancing a bricolage of materials and meanings that would echo into later high fashion interpretations of punk. Placed today within museum collections and scholarly discourse, the Destroy T-shirt stands as evidence of how punk aesthetics have been formalized and historicized, even as they retain their original intent to provoke, disrupt, and unsettle.

Vivienne believed that clothes are not just for looking nice: they can be used to share important messages! She talked about how we should take care of the world, the animals, and each other.

She worked with big groups like Greenpeace and others to help protect places like the Arctic. Vivienne believed that if people wore clothes with messages and talked about important things, they could help others understand why the planet and fairness are important.",

Westwood’s work increasingly blurred the line between style and protest, using clothing as a vehicle for advocacy rather than mere adornment. Martin Parr’s portrait of Vivienne Westwood in 2012 emphasizes her dual identity as both a designer and activist. While many remember Westwood for her influence on punk fashion and her innovative use of historical references in couture, by the 2010s she had become equally recognized for her commitment to political and environmental causes. In this image, the shirt she wears operates as a subtle but clear signifier of her beliefs, reflecting her efforts to bring attention to issues such as climate emergency, over-consumption, and grassroots activism. Throughout this period, Westwood leveraged fashion shows, public appearances, and even clothing graphics to amplify her advocacy, transcending traditional fashion boundaries to communicate urgency and dissent. This portrait thus documents not just a moment frozen in time but a designer whose personal style and activism were inseparable, demonstrating that fashion can serve as a platform for social and ecological commentary.

        "adult-expert-long": "Martin Parr’s 2012 portrait engages with the intersection of fashion iconography and political agency, portraying Westwood as a figure whose sartorial choices were inseparable from her activist rhetoric. Her shirt, worn in a public and artistic context, exemplifies how garments and imagery functioned as semiotic extensions of her advocacy, particularly regarding climate and human rights. Martin Parr’s photograph of Vivienne Westwood from 2012 can be read as a visual manifesto, capturing a designer who had long reconfigured fashion as a medium of cultural intervention. By this stage in her career, Westwood had codified her belief that fashion must transcend mere aesthetics to engage with socio-political crises; she once stated that her purpose was to use fashion as a “vehicle for activism,” particularly in the realm of climate change and environmental justice.  The shirt she wears in this portrait is emblematic of this ethos: it is not an arbitrary choice but a deliberate extension of her activist lexicon, aligning her personal identity with her public campaign work. Over the preceding decade, she collaborated with NGOs such as Greenpeace, designed logos for the Save the Arctic campaign, and launched the Climate Revolution movement, all of which foregrounded ecological advocacy within and beyond fashion circles. In this image, the convergence of Westwood’s sartorial authority and her political message is further illuminated by Parr’s photographic style, which tends to emphasize cultural identity and social commentary. The portrait thus situates Westwood not merely as a subject of fashion history but as an agent of cultural discourse, whose clothing choices operate as textual and visual arguments. This framing underscores how Westwood’s sartorial practice in the 21st century remained deeply rooted in political engagement: fashion, for her, was never neutral. Through public imagery, runway interventions, and personal appearance, she articulated a sustained critique of consumer culture, ecological neglect, and institutional inertia, a legacy that the 2012 portrait by Parr encapsulates."

      "description": "Chronicles of Fashion unfolds as a chronological narrative that situates Vivienne Westwood’s work within a broader cultural and historical continuum. The collection begins with the French artistic and historical references that inspired her vision and then progresses through her most emblematic punk designs, to conclude with her presence in contemporary media and popular culture, from Sex & The City and Nana to significant examples of her public activism. Collectively, these works trace not only the evolution of a designer, but the establishment of an enduring cultural legacy.",

From the raw energy of punk rebellion to refined tailoring and historical reinterpretation, each item embodies her revolutionary approach to fashion, transforming traditional forms such as the corset and Scottish tartan into symbols of power and innovation. Beyond their aesthetic impact, these works also carry her enduring commitment to activism, integrating social and environmental protest into the very fabric of design. Together, they reveal a vision defined not just by garments, but by the principles and audacity that make every object unmistakably Made by Vivienne.",

Starting with the historical and artistic references that nourished her imagination, the collection moves into the garments and accessories that exemplify her transformative approach to tradition, before closing with the many afterlives of her designs in contemporary media and popular culture, from the iconic wedding gown worn by Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City to the striking appearances of Westwood’s creations in Nana, alongside records that witness her public activism and irreverence. Overall, the collection aims at revealing the continuous exchange between past reference and future expression within Westwood’s creative universe.",
