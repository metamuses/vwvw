          <h2>The (virtual) museum content</h2>
          <p>
            The project design started with the research and selection of the museum collection.
            Starting from a previous university course project, called <a href="https://metamuses.github.io/lod-save-the-queen/" alt="Lod save the queen project">"Lod save the queen"</a>, for which we had already selected various cultural heritage object related to Vivienne Westwood,
            we focused on three different area of works related to the famous english designer's world: the punk heritage from the 70s, XVIII century France inspiration and Nana, the manga and anime inheritance.
            Moving from these three main area, each of us select 7 items related in some way to the chosen theme. The 21 selected item make up the whole museum and potentially could be organized in three separate rooms. Ideally a in-person visitor would visit the museum by browsing each room and grasping the variety of Vivienne's art.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/moodboard/content_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt=""><br>
            <p>From the item selection we moved onto the project/museum name brainstorming. Inspired by the MMMM title and concept, Multimedia Museum Meta Mirror,
            from the course project specification, we came up with Vivienne Westwood Virtual World to play onto the acronym VWVW and the concept of a virtual museum experience.
          </p>
          <h2>The virtual museum form</h2>
          <p>
            As a following step, we focused on the logo design and web-based narrative ideation.
            <br>
            The final svg logo form has been inspired by various museum's logo, by the project specification's logo and by the Vivienne Westwood brand logo.
            The result is a in-line reflected logo that report the acronym of the museum. A smaller version for the website favicon has been then produced as well.</p>
            <img src="img/moodboard/logo_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>The design of the web-based narratives moved from the idea that the visitor could benefit from a virtual experience, that enhance the in real life one or substitute it as a whole.
            What the website does is offering three alternative narratives for browsing the collection across the (virtual) rooms.
            This experience could be had on-line but also in person following the map that pin-point the route between items. <br>
            Has required by the project specification one of the web-based narrative is a diachronic virtual visits of the collection, "Chronicles of Fashion". After collecting the original date of the art work we create the first "lists of item". The user can follow this narrative to visit the museum virtually or not in a chronological order.
            The second web-based narrative, "Made by Vivienne", allows the user to browse the museum by exploring the item Vivienne Westwood designed. This narrative allows for a quicker and more fashion-oriented visits of the museum collection.
            Last but not least we designed the narrative "Enter the future", that let the user browse across the collection to explore the items that inspired Vivienne’s work and the work that she has inspired.
          </p>
          <h2>The museum website layout</h2>
          <p>
            Moving from the website requirements stated in the course's project specification, we started sketching possible layout and navigation tools for the three main pages of the website: homepage, narrative page, item page.<br>
            We started with a simple wireframing:
          </p>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4">
                  <img src="img/moodboard/homepage_wireframe.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                  <img src="img/moodboard/narrative_wireframe.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                  <img src="img/moodboard/item_wireframe.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
              </div>
          <p>
            The header allow the user to return to the homepage by clicking the logo and offers a main navigation bar: collections, info and style toggle.
            The footer contains a brief copyright statment and github repository.
            <br>
            In the homepage the user finds a brief explanation of the website purpouse and the three available narrative.
            By hovering the narrative's card the user can understand which museum's item are part of the selected narrative and the "route" to follow.
            The map itself allows for further navigation by hovering over to point to see the item's image and title.
            <br>
            The narrative page offers a more in-depth explanation of the reduced collection and the map with the chosen items.
            A small collection of the items that make up the narrative is offered by means of an image and small title.
            The idea of restraining the item's information to its image and title comes from the awarness that a museum is mainly a sight-experience and to encourage the user to browse to the single item page to increase its knowledge with the metadata information and virtual museum plaque.
            <br>
            The item page offer further navigation. Since the items are parts of various narrative the user is allowed to navigate accross them. Underneath the image item the user is allow to navigate backward and forward in the narrative's collection but can quickly "moved" to a different collection following value of the metadata key "collection".
            Each item is accompanied by a small collection of text. The text varies around 3 main axis: user's age, competence and text's lenght.
            The last section of the item page offers a collection of multimedia such as images, videos and articles. This selection follows the "real" museum organization, meaning that the item's multimedia are the same for the item's in the same "real" room rather than the item in the same web-based narrative. This allows for a connection between the museum and its virtual form.
          </p>
          </div>
          <h2>The museum website implementation</h2>
          <p>
            Once designed the wireframes we moved onto the actual website implementation. Each of team member focused on one of the webpage and started leveraging bootstrap classes in order to create a basic website layout to help us start visualizing the final website.<br>
            We took care of the web page loading logic, using data organized in the json file and populate the webpage via javascript. <br>
            It was crucial to also design a visual tool to navigate the collection and allow the user to orient themselves in the museum. We sketch a frontal view of the museum and the item's position. We finalized the design as an svg map as a base to be then browsed as stated earlier.</p>
            <img src="img/moodboard/map-design.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="">
            <img src="img/moodboard/map_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="">
          </p>
          <h2>Styles inspirations</h2>
          <p>
            The project specifications required six different style sheets to be applied to the whole web project based on historic period. From the general time-period requirment we moved on to more peculiar artistic inspiration. In particular the following are the moodboard that explains the themes inspirations and design.<br>
            Each of team member curated two of the themes css.
            <img src="img/moodboard/1700-france_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="700-france theme moodboard">
            <img src="img/moodboard/photo_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="daguerreotype theme moodboard">
            <img src="img/moodboard/art-noveau_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="art noveau theme moodboard">
            <img src="img/moodboard/punk_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="punk theme moodboard">
            <img src="img/moodboard/90s-comic_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="Enter the Future">
            <img src="img/moodboard/2035-solar-punk_moodboard.png" class="card-img-top d-block mx-auto" alt="Enter the Future">
          </p>
          <h2>Code revision and cleanup</h2>
          <p>
            Took care of the restructuring of the code, both css and javascript.
          </p>
          <h2>Multimedia, metadata and text production</h2>
          <p>
          The wesite offers a related-media section that allows the user to explore further the collection and explains the curatorial choices made by the team's members.
