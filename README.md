# Vivienne Westwood Virtual World

Group project for the Information Modeling and Web Technologies 2024/25 course.

The Vivienne Westwood Virtual World (VWVW) is designed to provide a virtual experience that can enhance or fully substitute an in-person visit to the imagined Vivienne Westwood museum. Users can explore the museum’s collection by following three web-based narratives—Chronicles of Fashion, Made by Vivienne, and Past and Future—each offering a different perspective on the museum's collection. The website allows for personalization, letting users select different visual styles and adjust informational text according to age, competence, and preferred length.
